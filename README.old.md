User Flow
---
1. User enters any email address, and password 'meld123'
2. User clicks log in
3. User authenticated and taken to devices screen
4. User presented with up-to-date (polls every 5 seconds) view of active devices
5. User clicks 'notify' to signify completion of the test

Additionally:
- When user logs in, they should remain logged in until they click "log out", or their browser data is cleared
- If password is incorrect, error message is shown
- On the devices screen, the circles orbit around the number
- On the devices screen, the number of circles shown should equal the number of active devices
